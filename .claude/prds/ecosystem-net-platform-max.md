# PRD: Ecosystem Net Platform Max

## Executive Summary

The Ecosystem Net Platform Max is a production-ready, multi-tenant SaaS platform that serves as a comprehensive foundation for building organization-aware applications. Built on Next.js 15 with Logto authentication, the platform provides enterprise-grade identity and access management, advanced organization management capabilities, and a complete OAuth provider system for third-party integrations.

The platform features a universal app architecture with four core sections (Inbox, Library, Catalog, Profile) and supports sophisticated multi-tenancy through organization-based data isolation, role-based access control, and tenant-aware API endpoints.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?

Modern SaaS applications require complex authentication, authorization, and multi-tenancy features that are time-consuming and error-prone to build from scratch. Organizations need:

1. **Secure, scalable authentication** with SSO, MFA, and social login support
2. **Organization-based multi-tenancy** with proper data isolation and role management
3. **Developer platform capabilities** including OAuth provider functionality for third-party integrations
4. **Production-ready architecture** with proper security, monitoring, and deployment patterns

### Why is this important now?

- Growing demand for B2B SaaS solutions with sophisticated tenant management
- Increasing security requirements and compliance standards (SOC2, GDPR)
- Need for platforms that can serve as OAuth providers for ecosystem development
- Developer expectations for modern authentication patterns and API-first design

## User Stories
