# PRD: Logto Authentication Testing & Resolution

## Executive Summary

The Net Ecosystem Platform has completed initial Logto authentication integration, but critical production errors are preventing proper multi-tenant functionality. This PRD defines the comprehensive testing infrastructure and systematic error resolution needed to achieve production-ready authentication across all user flows.

**Business Impact**: Authentication is the foundation of multi-tenant SaaS architecture. Unresolved auth issues block all organization-based features and prevent production deployment.

## Problem Statement

### Current State
- Logto redirect URI misconfiguration causing OAuth flow failures
- Organization API endpoints returning 500 errors due to authentication problems
- No systematic testing infrastructure for authentication flows
- Production deployment blocked by authentication reliability issues

### Why This Matters Now
- Multi-tenant architecture depends entirely on reliable authentication
- Customer onboarding impossible without working OAuth flows
- Organization switching and management features completely broken
- No confidence in authentication reliability for production deployment

## User Stories

### Primary Personas
1. **End Users** - Need seamless login/logout and organization switching
2. **Developers** - Need reliable auth testing and debugging capabilities  
3. **DevOps/QA** - Need comprehensive test coverage and monitoring

### Critical User Journeys

**Journey 1: New User Registration & Organization Setup**
- User clicks "Sign In" from application
- Redirects to Logto hosted login page
- User creates new account
- Returns to application with valid session
- User can create or join organizations
- Organization context properly established

**Journey 2: Existing User Authentication & Organization Access**
- User signs in with existing credentials
- Application fetches user's organizations
- User can switch between multiple organizations
- Organization-scoped API calls function correctly
- Proper session management and token refresh

**Journey 3: Organization Management Operations**
- Authenticated user can create new organizations
- User can invite/manage organization members
- Role-based access control functions properly
- Organization switching maintains proper context

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR1: Complete Testing Infrastructure**
- Playwright E2E test suite covering all authentication flows
- Unit tests for all authentication-related functions
- Integration tests for organization API endpoints
- Mocked Logto responses for isolated testing
- CI/CD integration with authentication test coverage

**FR2: Error Resolution & Configuration Fix**
- Fix redirect URI mismatch (callback vs api/logto/callback)
- Resolve organization API authentication failures
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- Validate all environment variable configurations
- Ensure token refresh and session management reliability

**FR3: Comprehensive Flow Coverage**
- Test all OAuth flows (authorization code, refresh token)
- Organization creation, switching, and management flows
- API authentication with organization-scoped tokens
- Error scenarios (expired tokens, network failures, invalid responses)
- Cross-browser and device compatibility testing

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance**
- Authentication flows complete within 3 seconds
- Organization switching under 1 second
- API calls with auth headers under 500ms
- Test suite execution under 5 minutes

**Security**
- All authentication tokens properly validated
- Organization data isolation verified
- CORS configuration secure for production
- No authentication credentials logged or exposed

**Reliability**
- 99.9% authentication success rate
- Graceful handling of Logto service outages
- Automatic token refresh without user interruption
- Proper error messaging for all failure scenarios

## Success Criteria

### Primary Metrics
1. **Zero authentication-blocking errors** - All identified OAuth and API errors resolved
2. **100% test coverage** - Every authentication flow covered by automated tests
3. **Sub-3-second auth flows** - All user authentication journeys complete quickly
4. **Production deployment ready** - All tests passing in staging environment

### Secondary Metrics
- Test suite runs in under 5 minutes
- All organization management operations functional
- Proper error handling implemented for all failure scenarios
- Documentation complete for all authentication patterns

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must use existing Logto instance (z3zlta.logto.app)
- Cannot modify Logto server-side configuration extensively
- Must maintain Next.js 15 App Router architecture
- Testing infrastructure must integrate with existing CI/CD

### Timeline Constraints
- Critical path item blocking production deployment
- Must be resolved within current sprint
- Testing infrastructure should be reusable for future features

### Resource Constraints
- Single developer implementation
- Must leverage existing testing tools and patterns
- Cannot introduce complex testing dependencies

## Out of Scope

### Explicitly Not Included
- Migration from Logto to alternative authentication providers
- Major architectural changes to authentication flow
- Custom OAuth server implementation
- Advanced security features beyond standard Logto capabilities
- Multi-domain authentication (subdomains per organization)

### Future Considerations
- Advanced role-based access control beyond admin/member/guest
- SSO integrations (SAML, enterprise auth)
- Advanced session management features
- Performance optimization beyond basic requirements

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- **Logto Service Availability** - z3zlta.logto.app must remain operational
- **Logto Management API** - Required for organization operations
- **Development Environment** - localhost:6789 configuration maintained

### Internal Dependencies
- **Environment Configuration** - All required env vars properly set
- **shadcn/ui Components** - For authentication UI components
- **Next.js App Router** - Authentication patterns depend on App Router
- **CI/CD Pipeline** - For automated test execution

### Blocker Resolution Required
1. **Current Redirect URI Fix** - Must be resolved before comprehensive testing
2. **Organization API Authentication** - Blocks organization-related test scenarios
3. **Environment Variable Validation** - Required for reliable test execution

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Error Resolution & Configuration (Week 1)
- Fix redirect URI configuration mismatch
- Resolve organization API authentication issues
- Validate and document all environment variables
- Implement proper error handling for API failures

### Phase 2: Core Testing Infrastructure (Week 1-2)
- Set up Playwright testing framework
- Create authentication flow test utilities
- Implement organization management test scenarios
- Add unit tests for authentication utilities

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Coverage & CI Integration (Week 2)
- Complete E2E test coverage for all identified flows
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline
- Performance testing and optimization
- Documentation and developer guides

### Testing Strategy

**Test Categories**
1. **Unit Tests** - Authentication utilities, token management, error handling
2. **Integration Tests** - API endpoints, organization operations, database interactions
3. **E2E Tests** - Complete user flows from login to organization management
4. **Security Tests** - Token validation, data isolation, CORS configuration

**Test Environment**
- Dedicated testing folder: `/tests/authentication/`
- Playwright configuration for multiple browser testing
- Mock Logto responses for isolated unit testing
- Staging environment validation before production

**Coverage Requirements**
- 100% of authentication-related functions
- All identified error scenarios
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Mobile and desktop responsive authentication flows

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **Logto Service Dependency** - External service availability impacts testing
- **Environment Configuration Complexity** - Multiple env vars must align correctly
- **OAuth Flow Complexity** - Authentication flows can be fragile

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive error handling for all external dependencies
- Environment variable validation utilities
- Detailed logging for authentication flow debugging
- Fallback mechanisms for degraded authentication scenarios
