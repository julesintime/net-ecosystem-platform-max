**Epic**: ecosystem-net-platform-max  
**Task**: 4  
**Created**: 2025-09-13T00:42:30Z  
**Status**: completed  
**Priority**: high  
**Estimated Effort**: 6 hours

**GitHub**: https://github.com/julesintime/net-ecosystem-platform-max/issues/11  

## Overview

Create a comprehensive Management API client with intelligent token caching to handle Logto organization operations efficiently. This builds upon the patterns established in the example/ directory while adding production-grade caching, rate limiting, and performance optimizations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Management API client with token caching system
- [ ] Secure token handling with automatic refresh mechanism
- [ ] Cached wrapper around Logto's organization endpoints
- [ ] Rate limiting strategy with configurable thresholds
- [ ] Proxy endpoints for organization CRUD operations
- [ ] Response times < 200ms for cached API calls
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Integration tests with mock API responses

## Technical Requirements

### Core Implementation
- Reuse and enhance patterns from `example/multi-tenant-saas-sample/`
- Implement token caching with TTL-based expiration
- Build rate limiting with sliding window algorithm
- Create organization endpoint proxies in Next.js API routes
- Add request/response caching with Redis-compatible interface

### Performance Targets
- Cache hit ratio > 85% for organization queries
- API response times < 200ms for cached calls
- Token refresh overhead < 50ms
- Memory usage < 10MB for cache storage

### Security Requirements
- Secure token storage with encryption at rest
- Automatic token rotation before expiration
- Request validation and sanitization
- Audit logging for all Management API calls

## Dependencies

**Depends On**: 
- Task 10 (Organization Template Configuration)

**Enables**:
- Task 5 (JWT Authorization Middleware)
- Task 6 (Organization-scoped API Routes)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core API Client (2 hours)
1. Create base Management API client class
2. Implement token acquisition and refresh logic
3. Add error handling and retry mechanisms
4. Create type definitions for Logto organization endpoints

### Phase 2: Caching Layer (2 hours)
1. Design cache key strategy for organizations
2. Implement in-memory cache with TTL support
3. Add cache invalidation patterns
4. Create cache statistics and monitoring

### Phase 3: Rate Limiting (1 hour)
1. Implement sliding window rate limiter
2. Add per-endpoint rate limiting rules
3. Create rate limit monitoring and alerts
4. Add graceful degradation strategies

### Phase 4: Proxy Endpoints (1 hour)
1. Create Next.js API routes for organization operations
2. Implement request validation and sanitization
3. Add response transformation and caching headers
4. Create endpoint documentation and examples

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Token caching and refresh logic
- Rate limiting algorithms
- Cache hit/miss scenarios
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end organization operations
- Cache performance under load
- Rate limiting behavior
- Token expiration handling

### Performance Tests
- Cache performance benchmarks
- API response time validation
- Memory usage monitoring
- Concurrent request handling

## Success Metrics

- API response times consistently < 200ms for cached calls
- Cache hit ratio > 85% after initial warm-up period
- Zero token-related authentication failures
- Rate limiting prevents API quota exhaustion
- Memory usage remains stable under load

## Risk Mitigation

- **Token Security**: Implement encrypted storage and secure transmission
- **Cache Consistency**: Add cache invalidation on organization updates
- **Rate Limiting**: Graceful degradation when limits are exceeded
- **API Changes**: Version-aware client with backward compatibility
- **Performance**: Circuit breaker pattern for failing upstream services

## Rollback Plan

1. Feature flag to disable caching and use direct API calls
2. Fallback to uncached Management API client
3. Rate limiting bypass for critical operations
4. Cache flush capability for corruption scenarios
