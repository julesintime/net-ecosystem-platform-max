# Organization Management UI Components

## Overview
Build comprehensive organization management UI using existing shadcn/ui components for member invitation, role assignment, and organization settings. This task leverages the existing component library to create a production-ready member management interface that integrates with Logto's organization template RBAC system.

- [ ] Add touch-friendly interaction patterns
- [ ] Test across different screen sizes and devices

### 7. Integration with Universal App Bar
- [ ] Add organization management access from Profile section
- [ ] Implement organization switching interface
- [ ] Create quick member invite shortcuts
- [ ] Add organization context to navigation
- [ ] Ensure consistent navigation patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete member management interface with invite/remove/role assignment
- [ ] Intuitive role assignment with clear permission descriptions
- [ ] Responsive design working on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Integration with Management API for all organization operations
- [ ] Error handling and loading states for all async operations
- [ ] Bulk operations for member management efficiency
- [ ] Organization settings interface for admin users
- [ ] Consistent with existing shadcn/ui design patterns

## Technical Requirements

### Component Architecture
- Use existing shadcn/ui components (Button, Dialog, Table, Form, etc.)
- Follow React Hook Form + Zod validation patterns
- Implement proper TypeScript typing for all components
- Use consistent styling with CSS variables and Tailwind classes

### Performance Targets
- Component render time < 100ms for member lists up to 1000 members
- Form validation feedback < 50ms
- API integration response handling < 200ms
- Optimistic updates for immediate user feedback

### Accessibility Requirements
- ARIA labels and roles for all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support for all interfaces
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast mode support
- Focus management for modals and dialogs

## Dependencies
- Task 12 (JWT Authorization Middleware) - for organization context
- Task 4 (Management API Client) - for backend operations
- Existing shadcn/ui component library
- React Hook Form and Zod for form handling

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Member Management (2 hours)
1. Create OrganizationMembersList component with data-table
2. Implement basic member invitation dialog
3. Add role assignment dropdown functionality
4. Connect to Management API for CRUD operations

### Phase 2: Advanced Member Features (2 hours)
1. Build bulk invitation and role assignment
2. Add member search and filtering capabilities
3. Implement invitation status tracking
4. Create member removal with confirmation

### Phase 3: Organization Settings (1.5 hours)
1. Build organization profile editing interface
2. Create organization deletion/transfer flows
3. Add organization customization options
4. Implement usage metrics display

### Phase 4: Polish and Integration (0.5 hours)
1. Add loading states and error handling
2. Implement responsive design refinements
3. Add optimistic updates for better UX
4. Integration testing with Universal App Bar

## Testing Strategy

### Component Tests
- Member list rendering with different data sets
- Invitation form validation and submission
- Role assignment functionality
- Organization settings form handling

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end member invitation flow
- Role assignment with API integration
- Organization settings update flow
- Bulk operations testing

### Accessibility Tests
- Keyboard navigation through all interfaces
- Screen reader compatibility testing
- Focus management in modals and dialogs
- Color contrast and visibility testing

### Responsive Design Tests
- Mobile device compatibility testing
- Tablet orientation changes
- Different screen resolutions
- Touch interaction testing

## Success Metrics
- Member management operations complete in < 3 clicks
- Invitation success rate > 95%
- Role assignment accuracy 100%
- Mobile usability score > 90%
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- API error rate < 1%

## Risk Mitigation
- **API Integration**: Implement comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- **Performance**: Use virtualization for large member lists
- **UX Consistency**: Follow existing shadcn/ui patterns strictly
- **Mobile Usability**: Test on real devices throughout development
- **Data Validation**: Client and server-side validation for all forms

## Security Considerations

### Permission Validation
- Verify user permissions before showing management interfaces
- Validate role assignment permissions based on user's current role
- Prevent elevation of privileges beyond user's own level
- Audit all organization management actions

### Data Protection
- Sanitize all user inputs in forms
- Validate email addresses for invitations
- Prevent unauthorized access to organization data
- Secure handling of invitation tokens

## Rollback Plan
1. Feature flags for individual components
2. Graceful degradation to basic member list
3. Fallback to API-only operations without UI
4. Emergency disable for critical issues
