# Stream A: Organization Template & Role Setup

## Scope
Configure organization template in Logto admin console with predefined roles and permissions, set up role hierarchy and organization-scoped permissions.

## Files
- Logto admin console configuration
- Documentation of permission mappings

## Progress
- ✅ Analyzed existing Logto configuration and integration documentation
- ✅ Created comprehensive organization template configuration documentation
- ✅ Defined organization-scoped permissions for business logic:
  - inbox:read/write - Communication hub access
  - library:read/write - Template and asset management
  - catalog:browse/install - App marketplace functionality  
  - profile:read/manage - Organization profile management
- ✅ Specified role hierarchy with proper permission mapping:
  - **Admin**: All permissions + organization management capabilities
  - **Member**: Full read/write access to inbox/library/catalog + profile:read
  - **Guest**: Read-only access to all sections
- ✅ Documented JWT token structure and organization context requirements
- ✅ Created step-by-step configuration guide for Logto admin console
- ✅ Documented permission matrix and security considerations
- ✅ Prepared testing and validation procedures

## Deliverables
- `/Users/xoojulian/Downloads/net-ecosystem-platform-max/docs/logto-organization-template-setup.md` - Complete configuration guide

## Next Steps for Manual Configuration
The following steps need to be completed in the Logto admin console at `https://z3zlta.logto.app/admin`:

1. Access Organizations → Organization Templates
2. Create "Net Ecosystem Platform Template" with specified roles and permissions
3. Configure default role assignments
4. Validate JWT token structure includes organization context
5. Test role-based access control

## Coordination Notes
- Stream A (Organization Template) is complete and ready for manual implementation
- Stream B (Authentication Setup) can proceed with role-based route protection
- Stream C (Testing) should wait for manual Logto configuration completion

## Status: COMPLETED - Ready for manual Logto admin configuration
