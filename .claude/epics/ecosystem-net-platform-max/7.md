2. Create organization management links
3. Implement current organization display
4. Add organization creation shortcuts

### Phase 2: Organization Switching Core (1.5 hours)
1. Build organization switching context provider
2. Implement token refresh on organization change
3. Create organization switching confirmation
4. Add loading states and error handling

### Phase 3: Context Integration (1 hour)
1. Add organization context to app sections
2. Implement organization-aware navigation
3. Create organization context persistence
4. Add organization branding integration

### Phase 4: Polish and Testing (0.5 hours)
1. Add animation and visual feedback
2. Test organization switching edge cases
3. Optimize performance and caching
4. Final integration testing

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Organization switching context provider
- Organization state persistence
- Profile dropdown functionality
- Organization context utilities

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end organization switching flow
- Profile section navigation
- Organization context propagation
- State persistence across browser sessions

### User Experience Tests
- Organization switching performance
- Mobile organization switching
- Error scenario handling
- Context preservation testing

### Performance Tests
- Organization switch timing
- Context provider rendering performance
- State persistence efficiency
- Memory usage optimization

## Success Metrics
- Organization switching completion rate > 98%
- Organization switch time < 2 seconds
- User satisfaction with organization management > 4.5/5
- Profile section usage increase > 50%
- Organization context accuracy 100%
- Mobile organization switching success rate > 95%

## Risk Mitigation
- **Context Loss**: Implement robust state persistence and recovery
- **Performance Impact**: Use React.memo and optimized re-rendering
- **Token Refresh Failures**: Graceful fallback to login redirect
- **Mobile UX**: Thorough mobile testing and optimization
- **Edge Cases**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

## Security Considerations

### Organization Access Validation
- Verify user's organization membership before switching
- Validate organization tokens on context changes
- Prevent unauthorized organization access
- Audit organization switching activities

### Data Protection
- Secure organization context transmission
- Validate organization branding resources
- Prevent organization data leakage between contexts
- Sanitize organization-specific settings

### Token Management
- Secure handling of organization-scoped tokens
- Automatic token refresh on organization changes
- Token validation before organization context usage
- Secure storage of organization preferences

## User Experience Design

### Organization Switching Flow
1. User clicks organization selector in profile
2. Organization list displays with current org highlighted
3. User selects new organization
4. Confirmation dialog if switching has significant impact
5. Loading state during token refresh and context switch
6. Success feedback and navigation to appropriate section

### Visual Feedback
- Clear current organization indication
- Loading spinners during switches
- Success/error toast notifications
- Smooth transitions between organization contexts

### Mobile Optimization
- Touch-friendly organization selector
- Responsive organization switching interface
- Mobile-optimized confirmation dialogs
- Swipe gestures for organization navigation

## Accessibility Requirements
- Keyboard navigation for organization switching
- Screen reader announcements for organization changes
- High contrast mode support
- Focus management during organization switches
- ARIA labels for organization context indicators

## Rollback Plan
1. Feature flag for organization switching functionality
2. Fallback to single organization mode
3. Graceful degradation of profile section enhancements
4. Emergency disable for critical organization switching issues
5. Backup organization context recovery mechanism
