# Issue #10 Analysis: Organization Template Configuration

## Work Stream Decomposition

### Stream A: Organization Template & Role Setup (Immediate Start)
**Agent Type**: general-purpose  
**Estimated Effort**: 1.5 hours  
**Dependencies**: None - can start immediately  

**Scope**:
- Access Logto admin console
- Create organization template with proper configuration
- Define role hierarchy (admin, member, guest)
- Configure role-specific permissions
- Set up organization-scoped permissions for business logic

**Tasks**:
1. Access Logto admin console and navigate to Organizations
2. Create new organization template for the platform
3. Define admin/member/guest roles with appropriate permissions
4. Configure organization-scoped permissions (inbox, library, catalog, profile)
5. Map roles to permissions according to specification

**Files/Resources**:
- Logto admin console configuration
- Documentation of permission mappings

### Stream B: Authentication & Sign-in Experience (Immediate Start)
**Agent Type**: general-purpose  
**Estimated Effort**: 1 hour  
**Dependencies**: None - can start in parallel with Stream A  

**Scope**:
- Configure sign-in experience with social providers
- Set up email/password authentication
- Configure application integration settings
- Set up organization invitation flow

**Tasks**:
1. Configure social providers (Google, GitHub, Microsoft)
2. Set up email/password authentication with policies
3. Customize sign-in page branding
4. Configure application-specific settings (redirects, CORS, tokens)
5. Set up organization invitation templates and flow

**Files/Resources**:
- Logto admin console sign-in experience
- Application integration settings
- Email templates configuration

### Stream C: Testing & Validation (Sequential - Depends on A & B)
**Agent Type**: test-runner  
**Estimated Effort**: 0.5 hours  
**Dependencies**: Must wait for Streams A & B to complete  

**Scope**:
- Test organization template functionality
- Validate role assignment and permissions
- Test authentication flows
- Verify JWT token structure

**Tasks**:
1. Create test organization using the template
2. Test role assignment and permission inheritance
3. Validate sign-in experience with different providers
4. Test organization invitation and acceptance flow
5. Verify JWT tokens contain proper organization context
6. Test permission validation in application context

**Files/Resources**:
- Test organization creation
- Authentication flow testing
- JWT token validation

## Coordination Strategy

### Immediate Parallel Execution
- **Stream A** and **Stream B** can run simultaneously
- No file conflicts between admin console configuration streams
- Both streams work in different areas of Logto admin

### Sequential Execution
- **Stream C** must wait for both A and B to complete
- Testing requires fully configured template and authentication

### Communication Points
- Stream A completion triggers availability for Stream C
- Stream B completion triggers availability for Stream C
- Both A and B must signal completion before C can begin

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Organization template created with all three roles
- [ ] Permissions properly mapped and tested
- [ ] Authentication flows working with all providers
- [ ] Organization invitation flow functional
- [ ] JWT tokens contain organization context
- [ ] All functionality validated through testing

## Risk Mitigation
- **Admin Console Access**: Ensure proper credentials before starting
- **Permission Conflicts**: Document all changes for rollback if needed
- **Social Provider Setup**: Test each provider individually
- **JWT Structure**: Validate token format matches application expectations
