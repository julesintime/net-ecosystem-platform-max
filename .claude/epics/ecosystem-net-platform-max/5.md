# JWT Authorization Middleware and Organization Context

**Epic**: ecosystem-net-platform-max  
**Task**: 5  
**Created**: 2025-09-13T00:42:30Z  
**Status**: pending  
**Priority**: high  
**Estimated Effort**: 4 hours  

## Overview

Implement high-performance JWT authorization middleware that extracts organization context from JWT tokens and provides stateless authorization without database queries. This middleware will parse organization IDs from JWT audience claims and extract user permissions for organization-scoped request validation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] JWT middleware for organization context extraction
- [ ] Parse organization ID from audience claim format "urn:logto:organization:{orgId}"
- [ ] Extract user permissions and scopes from JWT payload
- [ ] Organization-scoped request validation system
- [ ] JWT processing overhead < 5ms per request
- [ ] Stateless authorization without database lookups
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling for malformed tokens
- [ ] Request context enrichment with organization data

## Technical Requirements

### Core Implementation
- Parse and validate JWT tokens from Authorization headers
- Extract organization ID from audience claim format
- Decode user permissions and scopes from token payload
- Create organization context object for downstream handlers
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) validation

### Performance Targets
- JWT processing overhead < 5ms per request
- Zero database queries for authorization decisions
- Memory usage < 1MB for middleware state
- Support for 1000+ concurrent requests

### Security Requirements
- Validate JWT signature and expiration
- Verify audience and issuer claims
- Sanitize extracted organization context
- Prevent JWT replay attacks with nonce validation
- Audit logging for authorization decisions

## Dependencies

**Depends On**: 
- Task 4 (Management API Client and Token Caching)

**Parallel With**:
- Can be developed alongside other authentication tasks

**Enables**:
- Task 6 (Organization-scoped API Routes)
- Task 7 (Multi-tenant Data Access Layer)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: JWT Parser and Validator (1.5 hours)
1. Create JWT token validation utility
2. Implement organization ID extraction from audience claims
3. Add token expiration and signature verification
4. Create comprehensive error handling for token issues

### Phase 2: Organization Context Builder (1 hour)
1. Design organization context data structure
2. Extract user permissions and scopes from JWT
3. Build role hierarchy and permission mapping
4. Create context enrichment for Next.js requests

### Phase 3: Authorization Middleware (1 hour)
1. Implement Next.js middleware for JWT processing
2. Add request path-based authorization rules
3. Create organization-scoped request validation
4. Add performance monitoring and metrics

### Phase 4: Testing and Optimization (0.5 hours)
1. Performance benchmarks and optimization
2. Security testing for token manipulation
3. Error scenario testing and handling
4. Integration testing with API routes

## Technical Specifications

### JWT Audience Claim Format
```
"aud": ["urn:logto:organization:org_12345", "api_resource_id"]
```

### Organization Context Structure
```typescript
interface OrganizationContext {
  organizationId: string;
  userId: string;
  permissions: string[];
  scopes: string[];
  roles: string[];
  tokenExpiry: number;
  issuedAt: number;
}
```

### Performance Requirements
- JWT parsing: < 2ms
- Permission extraction: < 1ms
- Context building: < 1ms
- Middleware overhead: < 1ms
- Total processing: < 5ms

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- JWT token parsing and validation
- Organization ID extraction accuracy
- Permission and scope parsing
- Error handling for malformed tokens

### Performance Tests
- JWT processing speed benchmarks
- Memory usage under load
- Concurrent request handling
- Middleware overhead measurement

### Security Tests
- Token tampering detection
- Expired token handling
- Invalid signature rejection
- Audience claim validation

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end request authorization
- Organization context propagation
- API route protection verification
- Error response consistency

## Success Metrics

- JWT processing consistently < 5ms per request
- Zero false positives in authorization decisions
- 100% accuracy in organization ID extraction
- No performance degradation under 1000+ concurrent requests
- Complete audit trail for all authorization decisions

## Risk Mitigation

- **JWT Security**: Implement comprehensive token validation
- **Performance**: Cache frequently accessed permission data
- **Reliability**: Graceful degradation for token parsing failures
- **Scalability**: Stateless design with no shared state
- **Debugging**: Detailed logging for authorization failures

## Security Considerations

### Token Validation
- Verify JWT signature with Logto public keys
- Validate audience claims match expected format
- Check token expiration and not-before claims
- Prevent replay attacks with request timestamps

### Organization Isolation
- Ensure organization ID extraction is tamper-proof
- Validate user permissions are organization-scoped
- Prevent cross-organization data access
- Audit all organization context decisions

## Rollback Plan

1. Feature flag to bypass JWT middleware for debugging
2. Fallback to basic token validation without organization context
3. Emergency disable for critical authorization issues
4. Rollback to database-based authorization if needed
