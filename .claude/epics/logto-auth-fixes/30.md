# Task: End-to-End Authentication Validation and Testing

## Description
Implement comprehensive manual testing validation and create basic E2E automation to verify complete authentication journey works end-to-end and prevent future regressions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Manual testing checklist covers complete authentication flow
- [ ] All three original error scenarios completely resolved
- [ ] Basic E2E test runs successfully with Playwright
- [ ] Authentication performance meets benchmark requirements (<3s flows)
- [ ] Documentation of working authentication procedures

## Technical Details

### Manual Testing Checklist
1. **New User Registration Flow**: Sign up → Email verification → Profile setup → Organization access
2. **Existing User Login Flow**: Sign in → Organization context restoration → Feature access
3. **Organization Management**: Switch organizations → Access organization data → Permissions validation
4. **Session Management**: Browser refresh → Session persistence → Timeout handling
5. **Sign-out Flow**: Clean logout → Redirect to homepage → No OIDC errors

### E2E Test Implementation
- **Test File**: `tests/e2e/critical-auth-flow.spec.ts`
- **Test Scope**: Sign in → Get organizations → Access features → Sign out
- **Browser Coverage**: Chrome (primary), Firefox/Safari (if time permits)
- **Environment**: Against localhost:6789 development server

### Performance Validation
- **Authentication Flow**: <3 seconds from sign-in to authenticated state
- **Organization API**: <500ms response time for authenticated requests  
- **Sign-out Process**: <2 seconds with proper cleanup
- **Session Persistence**: Immediate restoration on browser refresh

### Documentation Requirements
- Working authentication configuration reference
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Testing procedures for future development
- Performance benchmarks and monitoring setup

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 003 completed (OAuth callback fixed)
- [ ] Task 004 completed (Organization API fixed)
- [ ] All authentication errors resolved

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 4 hours
- Parallel: false (requires all fixes to be implemented)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Complete manual test passes 100% consistently
- [ ] Basic E2E test runs successfully and can be integrated into development workflow
- [ ] All original error scenarios completely eliminated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met for all authentication operations
- [ ] Authentication system stable and reliable for development use
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation and procedures created
