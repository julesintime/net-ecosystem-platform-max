# Task: Environment Setup and Error Reproduction

## Description
Set up comprehensive debugging environment and systematically reproduce all three critical authentication failures to establish baseline understanding before implementing fixes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Development environment running stable on localhost:6789
- [ ] All three authentication errors reproduced and documented with specific steps
- [ ] Error scenarios captured with browser debugging tools
- [ ] M2M credentials validated and working with Logto Management API
- [ ] Current Logto app configuration documented as baseline

## Technical Details

### Error Reproduction Requirements
1. **Sign-out Error**: Reproduce `post_logout_redirect_uri not registered` error
   - URL: `https://z3zlta.logto.app/oidc/session/end?client_id=m07bzoq8ltp8fswv7m2y8&post_logout_redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A6789`
   - Expected: OIDC invalid_request error

2. **Organization API Error**: Reproduce 401 Unauthorized from `/api/organizations`
   - Trigger: Sign in and attempt to access organization features
   - Expected: Console error in `components/providers/organization-provider.tsx:54:15`

3. **OAuth Callback Error**: Reproduce authentication callback failure
   - Trigger: Complete Logto authentication flow
   - Expected: 307 redirect to `/?error=auth_failed`

### Environment Validation
- Verify all environment variables are correctly set
- Test M2M credentials against Logto Management API
- Document current redirect URI configuration
- Set up browser debugging tools for OAuth flow analysis

## Dependencies
- [ ] Working Next.js development environment
- [ ] Valid M2M credentials for Logto Management API
- [ ] Access to Logto admin console for configuration review

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 4 hours
- Parallel: false (foundational task required for all others)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All three error scenarios consistently reproducible
- [ ] Detailed error reproduction steps documented
- [ ] Current authentication flow mapped and understood
- [ ] M2M API access validated and tested
- [ ] Environment ready for systematic debugging
