# Task: Performance Validation and Optimization

## Description
Implement performance testing and optimization for authentication flows to meet the specified benchmarks: authentication flows <3 seconds, organization switching <1 second, API calls <500ms, test suite execution <5 minutes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Authentication flow performance measured and optimized
- [ ] Organization switching performance meets <1 second requirement
- [ ] API calls with auth headers complete in <500ms
- [ ] Test suite execution optimized to <5 minutes
- [ ] Performance regression testing implemented
- [ ] Performance monitoring and alerting for critical flows

## Technical Details
- **Performance Targets**:
  - Authentication flows: <3 seconds end-to-end
  - Organization switching: <1 second
  - API calls with auth headers: <500ms
  - Test suite execution: <5 minutes
- **Measurement Areas**:
  - OAuth flow completion time
  - Token validation middleware performance
  - Organization context switching
  - Test execution parallelization
- **Files to Create**:
  - `tests/performance/auth-flow-timing.spec.ts`
  - `tests/performance/api-performance.spec.ts`
  - `tests/performance/organization-switching.spec.ts`
  - `lib/utils/performance-monitoring.ts`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 004 completed (authentication flows working)
- [ ] Task 005 completed (organization flows working)
- [ ] Performance testing tools available

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 6
- Parallel: true (can run after E2E tests are working)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All performance benchmarks met and validated
- [ ] Performance regression tests in place
- [ ] Optimization recommendations implemented
- [ ] Performance monitoring integrated
- [ ] Test suite execution time under 5 minutes
- [ ] Performance documentation and guidelines created
