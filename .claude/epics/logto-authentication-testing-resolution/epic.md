# Epic: Logto Authentication Testing & Resolution

## Overview

Implement comprehensive testing infrastructure and resolve critical authentication failures in the Net Ecosystem Platform. Focus on fixing the redirect URI mismatch, organization API authentication errors, and establishing production-ready testing coverage with Playwright E2E tests. The solution leverages existing Next.js App Router patterns and Logto configuration while minimizing code changes.

## Architecture Decisions

**Testing Framework**: Playwright for E2E testing - industry standard with excellent Next.js integration, supports all browsers, and handles authentication flows reliably.

**Test Organization**: Single controllable test folder structure (`/tests/authentication/`) with utilities for mocking Logto responses and managing test state.

**Error Resolution Approach**: Fix configuration issues first (redirect URI), then systematically address API authentication problems by validating token flows and middleware.

**Minimal Code Changes**: Leverage existing authentication infrastructure, focus on configuration fixes and testing rather than architectural changes.

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **No new UI components required** - leverage existing authentication UI
- **Test utilities** for simulating user authentication flows
- **Error boundary improvements** for better authentication error handling
- **Organization context debugging** utilities

### Backend Services
- **Configuration validation** utilities for environment variables
- **Enhanced error handling** in organization API endpoints  
- **Token validation middleware** improvements
- **Authentication flow debugging** endpoints (test environment only)

### Infrastructure  
- **Playwright test framework** setup with browser automation
- **Test environment** configuration with mocked Logto responses
- **CI/CD integration** for automated authentication testing
- **Environment variable validation** scripts

## Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: Critical Error Resolution (Days 1-2)**
- Fix redirect URI configuration mismatch 
- Resolve organization API authentication middleware issues
- Validate all environment variables and configuration

**Phase 2: Testing Infrastructure (Days 3-4)**
- Implement Playwright test framework with authentication utilities
- Create comprehensive E2E test coverage for all user journeys
- Add unit tests for authentication helper functions

**Phase 3: Validation & CI Integration (Day 5)**
- Performance testing and optimization
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Production readiness validation

Total tasks: 8
Parallel tasks: 4
Sequential tasks: 4
Estimated total effort: 60 hours

## Dependencies

**External Dependencies**
- Logto service availability (z3zlta.logto.app) - must remain operational during testing
- Logto Management API access for organization operations
- Development environment stability (localhost:6789)

**Internal Dependencies**  
- Environment variable configuration must be complete and validated
- Next.js App Router architecture maintained
- Existing shadcn/ui components for authentication UI

**Critical Path**
- Redirect URI fix blocks all OAuth testing
- Organization API authentication fix required before org-related testing
- Playwright setup must be complete before comprehensive testing

## Success Criteria (Technical)

**Performance Benchmarks**
- Authentication flows complete in <3 seconds
- Organization switching in <1 second  
- API calls with auth headers in <500ms
- Test suite execution in <5 minutes

**Quality Gates** 
- Zero authentication-blocking errors in production scenarios
- 100% test coverage for all authentication flows
- All E2E tests passing consistently in CI/CD
- No authentication credentials exposed in logs or errors

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Complete user authentication journeys work end-to-end
- Organization management operations functional
- Proper error handling for all failure scenarios
- Production deployment confidence achieved

## Estimated Effort

**Overall Timeline**: 5 days (single developer)

**Resource Requirements**
- 1 full-stack developer
- Access to Logto admin console for configuration validation
- Development environment with all dependencies

**Critical Path Items**
1. Redirect URI configuration fix (4 hours)
2. Organization API authentication resolution (8 hours)  
3. Playwright E2E test implementation (16 hours)
4. CI/CD integration and validation (8 hours)

**Risk Mitigation**: Additional 2 days buffer for complex OAuth debugging or unexpected Logto API issues.
