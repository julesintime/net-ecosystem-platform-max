# Task: E2E Organization Management Tests

## Description
Implement comprehensive E2E tests for organization creation, switching, member management, and role-based access control. Test all organization-related user journeys to ensure multi-tenant functionality works properly from the user perspective.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Organization creation flow tested end-to-end
- [ ] Organization switching and context management verified
- [ ] Member invitation and management flows tested
- [ ] Role-based access control (admin/member/guest) validated
- [ ] Organization data isolation verified
- [ ] Multiple organization scenarios covered

## Technical Details
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Create new organization → set up initial configuration
  - Switch between multiple organizations → context updates
  - Invite members → role assignment → permission validation
  - Organization deletion and cleanup
  - Cross-organization data isolation verification
- **Files to Create**:
  - `tests/authentication/organization/creation.spec.ts`
  - `tests/authentication/organization/switching.spec.ts`
  - `tests/authentication/organization/member-management.spec.ts`
  - `tests/authentication/organization/role-permissions.spec.ts`
  - `tests/authentication/organization/data-isolation.spec.ts`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 004 completed (authentication flows working)
- [ ] Organization API endpoints functional
- [ ] Organization context management working

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 12
- Parallel: false (requires authentication tests working first)

- [ ] Multi-tenant data isolation properly validated
- [ ] Role-based access control thoroughly tested
- [ ] Organization switching works seamlessly
