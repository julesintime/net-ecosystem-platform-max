# Task: Unit Test Coverage for Authentication Utilities

## Description
Implement comprehensive unit tests for all authentication-related utilities, token management, error handling, and helper functions. Ensure 100% test coverage for critical authentication logic with verbose, debugging-friendly tests.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests for all authentication utility functions
- [ ] Token management and validation logic tested
- [ ] Error handling scenarios covered
- [ ] Environment variable validation utility tested
- [ ] Organization context management functions tested
- [ ] 100% code coverage for authentication modules

## Technical Details
- **Test Targets**:
  - `lib/auth/logto-config.ts` - configuration and validation
  - `lib/middleware/api-auth.ts` - token validation middleware
  - `lib/utils/organization-storage.ts` - organization context management
  - `hooks/use-organization*.ts` - organization-related hooks
  - Error handling utilities and helpers
- **Files to Create**:
  - `tests/unit/auth/logto-config.test.ts`
  - `tests/unit/auth/api-auth.test.ts`
  - `tests/unit/utils/organization-storage.test.ts`
  - `tests/unit/hooks/organization-hooks.test.ts`
  - `tests/unit/auth/error-handling.test.ts`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002 completed (authentication utilities working)
- [ ] Jest or similar testing framework available
- [ ] Test utilities for mocking external dependencies

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8
- Parallel: true (can run alongside E2E development)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All authentication utility functions have unit tests
- [ ] Edge cases and error scenarios thoroughly covered
- [ ] Verbose test output for debugging capabilities
- [ ] 100% test coverage achieved for critical authentication code
- [ ] Tests run reliably in CI environment
- [ ] Mock dependencies properly isolated
