# Task: Organization API Authentication Fix

## Description
Debug and resolve the "Failed to fetch organizations" error in the organization provider. The error occurs in `components/providers/organization-provider.tsx:54` when calling `/api/organizations`. Fix authentication middleware issues and ensure proper token validation for organization-scoped API calls.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Organization API endpoints return proper responses (not 500 errors)
- [ ] Organization provider successfully fetches user organizations
- [ ] Token validation middleware works correctly for organization endpoints
- [ ] Proper error handling implemented for API failures
- [ ] Organization switching and context management functional

## Technical Details
- **Primary Issue**: Authentication middleware failing for organization API calls
- **Error Location**: `components/providers/organization-provider.tsx:54`
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/organizations` (GET method)
- **Files Affected**: 
  - `app/api/organizations/route.ts`
  - `lib/middleware/api-auth.ts`
  - `components/providers/organization-provider.tsx`
- **Root Cause**: Token validation or Management API authentication issues

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 completed (redirect URI and env validation fixed)
- [ ] Logto Management API credentials verified
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8
- Parallel: false (depends on configuration fix)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Organization API authentication middleware debugged and fixed
- [ ] Organization provider successfully fetches organizations without errors
- [ ] Organization switching works end-to-end
- [ ] Proper error handling and user feedback implemented
- [ ] All organization management operations functional
