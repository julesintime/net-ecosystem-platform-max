# Task: Playwright Test Framework Setup

## Description
Install and configure Playwright testing framework with authentication utilities for comprehensive E2E testing. Create test environment setup, authentication helpers, and mock Logto response utilities for isolated testing scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Playwright installed and configured for Next.js project
- [ ] Test environment configuration created (`/tests/authentication/`)
- [ ] Authentication test utilities implemented (login, logout, session management)
- [ ] Mock Logto response utilities for isolated testing
- [ ] Browser configuration for multi-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Test data management and cleanup utilities

## Technical Details
- **Framework**: Playwright for E2E testing with Next.js integration
- **Test Structure**: `/tests/authentication/` directory
- **Key Components**:
  - Playwright configuration file
  - Authentication helper utilities
  - Mock Logto service responses
  - Test data setup/teardown
  - Multi-browser configuration
- **Files to Create**:
  - `playwright.config.ts`
  - `tests/authentication/utils/auth-helpers.ts`
  - `tests/authentication/utils/mock-logto.ts`
  - `tests/authentication/fixtures/test-data.ts`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 completed (configuration fixed for reliable testing)
- [ ] Node.js development environment
- [ ] Package.json updated with test scripts

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 6
- Parallel: true (can run independently after config fix)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Playwright framework installed and configured
- [ ] Test utilities created for authentication scenarios
- [ ] Mock services implemented for isolated testing
- [ ] Multi-browser configuration working
- [ ] Test environment properly isolated from development
- [ ] Basic smoke test passing to validate setup
