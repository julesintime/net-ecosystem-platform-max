# Task: E2E Authentication Flow Tests

## Description
Implement comprehensive E2E tests for all user authentication journeys including new user registration, existing user login, logout, and session management. Cover all critical authentication scenarios from the user perspective with Playwright automation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] New user registration and first-time setup flow tested
- [ ] Existing user login flow with valid credentials
- [ ] Logout flow and session cleanup verification
- [ ] Session persistence and token refresh scenarios
- [ ] Authentication error handling (invalid credentials, expired tokens)
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing

## Technical Details
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - New user registration → organization setup → app access
  - Existing user login → organization context restoration
  - Session timeout and token refresh handling
  - Authentication errors and user feedback
  - Logout and session cleanup
- **Files to Create**:
  - `tests/authentication/flows/registration.spec.ts`
  - `tests/authentication/flows/login.spec.ts`  
  - `tests/authentication/flows/logout.spec.ts`
  - `tests/authentication/flows/session-management.spec.ts`
  - `tests/authentication/flows/error-scenarios.spec.ts`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002 completed (API authentication working)
- [ ] Task 003 completed (Playwright framework setup)
- [ ] Functional authentication flows in development

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 10
- Parallel: false (requires API and framework setup)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All authentication flows covered with E2E tests
- [ ] Tests pass consistently across multiple browsers
- [ ] Proper error scenario coverage and validation
- [ ] Session management thoroughly tested
- [ ] Tests integrated with CI pipeline requirements
- [ ] Test documentation and maintenance guidelines
